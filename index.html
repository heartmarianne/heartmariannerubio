          Sprawling in a 4,653.7- hectare land reservation, 19 kilometers from
          Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental and 17 kilometers from the town of
          Mabinay, Oriental Negros, the Central Philippines State University
          (CPSU) is dubbed as the first agricultural Institution in the country.
          It was established by a Filipino superintendent in the name of
          Professor Jose F. Crisanto immediately after World War II. CPSU is
          located in the heart of Negros Island, 108 kilometers from Bacolod
          City, Negros Occidental and 97 kilometers from Dumaguete City,
          Oriental Negros in the southeast. The colorful history of CPSU started
          when House bill No. 396 was introduced by Hon. Congressmen Carlos
          Hilado and co-authored by Congressman Limasiaco , Medina , Formilleza
          , Nietes and Arnold for the purpose of establishing one agricultural
          school in Negros Occidental of the Central Luzon Agricultural School
          type. One of the immediate missions of the school was to hasten
          economic development of the country which was in the process of
          reconstruction by training the youth in scientific agriculture. House
          bill no. 396 had ripened into Republic Act No. 43 that officially
          created the and Negros Occidental Agricultural School (NONAS) on
          October 2, 1946. It became operational on August 1 of the following
          year. Had an Act No. 74 of the US Phil. Commission of 1901 been
          implemented as planned and approved, NONAS should have been the
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          first three schools in the Philippines during the American regime
          namely: Philippine Normal School of Arts and Traders in Luzon and
          agricultural school in Negros Island. The first two schools were not
          Philippines respectively, while the agricultural school supposed to
          have been established in the island of Negros was not realized due to
          unknown reasons. The school was converted to NEGROS OCCIDENTAL
          AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE by virtue of Presidential Authority on September
          6, 1977 NONAS has served the pioneering students for 31 years from
          1946 – 1977 while NOAC steadfastly , turned out both college and high
          school graduates for 24 years prior to its conversion to NSCA. NOAC
          then was converted into state college known as the Negros State
          College of Agriculture (NSCA) by virtue of R.A. 9141 date July 3,
          2001. Hon. Congressman Genaro “Lim-ao” Alvarez, Jr. of the 6th
          District of Negros Occidental sponsored House Bill No. 9873 which was
          co-authored by Hon. Congressman Cojuangco, Montemayor, Montilla,
          Teodoro and Villar and the Congresswoman Marcos and Villaneuva in the
          House of Representatives. In the Senate Hon. Senator Juan Ponce Enrile
          was the first to file Senate Bill No. 1920 which followed by Hon.
          Senator Loren Legarda Livestre who also filed Senate Bill No. 1927 all
          taking into consideration House Bill No. 9873. Finally, Hon. Senators
          Tessie Aquino-Oreta and John H. Osmeña filed
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Senate Bill No. 2263 in substitution of the Senate earlier introduced
          by Senators Enrile and Legarda-Leviste. To Co-sponsors of the Senate
          Bill No. 2263 were Senators Biazon , Flavier , Jaworski, Magsaysay,
          Ople, Pimentel , Revilla , Roco , Sotto , and Tatad. Its conversion
          was meant ti maintain, strengthen and expand the originally of lifted
          expertise of NOAC by creating five Extension campuses. Four (4) of
          which had already been opened in the City of Sipalay and the
          Municipalities of Cauayan , Ilog , and Candoni for the six years. The
          proposed campus of Hinoba-an is waiting for their opening by the
          beginning of the next school year when funds become available. Today,
          CPSU main campus is traversed by an all-weather national highway and
          accessible to regular buses and jeepneys plying Bacolod via Kabankalan
          City in the occidental sides and Dumaguete City via the Municipality
          of Mabinay in the oriental side. It can also be reached from various
          points in Negos either by air through Bacolod City to Dumaguete City
          airports or by sea through regular fast crafts and ships at any point
          in the Visayas. NSCA has been attracting students not only from the
          different towns in Negros but also from the neighboring island
          provinces in the Western Visayas Region. Its agricultural programs and
          constantly drawn clients who wish to acquire appropriate technology
          and skills for productive, decent and gainful living.
